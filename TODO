Requested feature for version 2
===============================

- filtering for invalid text such as smart quotes which invalidate the XML saves

+ zip'ed file format to avoid file corruption via email (OWA specifically)

- better zooming interface

+ minimisation of algorithms to headers

- declared types for parameters and return values

+ tree datatype

+ expanded graphics type, or get rid of it

- runtime display of changing variable values, therefore also either step-by-step execution or slow-mo execution

+ highlighting of blocks causing program errors

+ more compact, user-friendly error messages

+ categorisation of blocks

+ proper distribution, probably JAR based

- better test suite

- multi-page printing for algorithms, sort DPI guessing for printers

+ ability to stop user program running

+ number keypad on literal integer input to help for touch input, something for literal boolean too.

- BUG fix issue throughout getWorkspaceObjectForPart where there is no check that sink.getContainedPart() is not itself null.

+ BUG Only a single output window should appear.  Currently they are repeatedly created.  Is this actually a bug, or a feature to compare output of multiple runs?? NOT A BUG.

- BUG Make sure all split actions are happening properly.
  This now seems mostly fixed.  Need to check Algorithm and Call in RAW, and split() listener in each workspace object subclass.

- BUG100 run button on CALL block sometimes disappears when collapsed and expanded?

+ show alg name even when collapsed

+ BUG101 "new" menu option should show lost work warning

+ BUG102 icons don't appear in jar

+ BUG103 window starts off screen due to hard-coded position for testing

- BUG104 JCompactablePanel should have a min width equal to header button width

+ BUG105 icons don't work for JCompactablePanel; need to load resources via class but is static

+ BUG106 add tooltip descriptions to new launcher headings, and to tree blocks

+ BUG107 StatementSequence does not resize correctly when adding new lines, until you move it.

- BUG108 make the sidebar slidy instead of horizontal scollbar.

+ FEA100 Add menu items to expand or collapse all top-level blocks in one go.

+ BUG109 algorithm formal args panel doesn't redraw correctly when adding new args.

- BUG110 collapsing a block immediately after creation, without moving it, leaves it at it's old size until moved.

+ BUG111 can add non-trees as subtrees in Node block.  Difficult to check because combined part does not have to be a node by itself, it could be an algorithm returning a node, etc.

- BUG112 when printing in b&w, expression and statement colours appear the same.

+ BUG113 trees lazy evaluate their internal values (mistakingly), so returning a tree which contains a variable reference results in the reference not being found because the stack frame has already popped.  Need to re-write trees to be had TreeXXX classes and actual storage classes.

- BUG114 make sure that all XXXWorkspaceObjects throw NotEnoughArgumentsExceptions if they have empty sinks.  Think all done except Algorithm and Call.

- BUG115 create algorithm with 1 parameter.  create call block to it.  change algorithm to 3 parameters.  call block will not change.  running the program gives a generic error about empty block, but visually the call block only has the original 1 parameter space.

+ BUG116 literal strings can include double-quotes that breaks loading.

- BUG117 check all string handling (alg names, literals, vars, etc) do not have smart quotes bug or BUG116 or any other XML escaped-required chars: & -> &amp;  < -> &lt;  > -> &gt;   " -> &quot;   ' -> &apos;

- BUG 118 enable printing for the HelpViewer

- Check printing works correctly when main display zoomed.
